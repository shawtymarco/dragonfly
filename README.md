# Dragonfly

Dragonfly is a heavily asynchronous server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition written in Go. It was written with scalability
and simplicity in mind and aims to make the process of setting up a server and modifying it easy. Unlike other
Minecraft server software, Dragonfly is generally used as a library to extend.

## Getting started
Running Dragonfly requires at least **Go 1.26**. After starting the server through one of the methods below,
**ctrl+c** may be used to shut down the server. Also check out the [wiki](https://github.com/df-mc/dragonfly/wiki) for
more detailed info.

### Per-player swimming policy (fork)

Swimming remains enabled by default. Set `[Players] DisableSwimming = true` in
`config.toml`, or `server.Config.DisableSwimming = true`, to disable the swimming
pose for new connections. `player.Config.DisableSwimming` provides the same
initial policy when creating a player directly. On the player's world owner,
`p.SetSwimmingEnabled(false)` disables it and `p.SetSwimmingEnabled(true)` allows
the next swim request; `p.SwimmingEnabled()` reports the policy.

Disabling an active swim restores the normal pose, collider and eye height for
all viewers. Rejected legacy and modern swim inputs correct the controlling
client's swimming metadata. This is not an immobilisation or water-access rule:
ordinary water movement, crawling and gliding are unchanged. The policy follows
the handle across worlds but is intentionally omitted from `Player.Data()` and
the default player database. Reconnects use the configured default again;
gameplay may apply a per-player override after joining. No protocol layout or
version-specific adapter changes are required. Real-client pose prediction and
animation still need validation for each supported client family.
